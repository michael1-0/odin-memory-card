# odin-memory-card

This is a project submission for The Odin Project's Full Stack Javasript path, React Project: Memory Card.

The goal of this project was to familiarize myself with React, especially the concept of side-effects and fetching from an external API, and managing components in general.

[pokeapi.co API](https://pokeapi.co/) was used to get pokemon data.
